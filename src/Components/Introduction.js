				<h1>Introduction</h1>
				<p>On September 6, 1915, police detective Jack Walters (voiced by Milton Lawrence) is summoned to the siege of a decrepit manor house in Boston. The manor is inhabited by a bizarre cult called the Fellowship of the Yith, led by one Victor Holt who has asked specifically for Walters to come and talk to him. Taking cover from an ensuing firefight, Walters finds himself separated from the police and trapped inside the mansion, with no option but to investigate. He finds the cultists dead by mass suicide and discovers a strange looking contraption and after turning it on, it reveals to be a portal. Walters sees two alien beings emerging from the portal and blacks out. When the rest of the police finally break in, they find Walters apparently insane. He is committed to Arkham Asylum, where he stays for six years but to Walters, it was only five months. He has no recollection of being in the asylum for six years nor the actual reason why he became insane in the first place. </p>
